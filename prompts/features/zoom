[zoom levels and ratios]

    right now, there is a default zoom level. That default zoom level 
    shows cells at some length and width. We want to leave that exactly
    as is. We need to edit the max zoomed out level such that 16x16 cells
    has the same length and width at the max zoomed out amount that the 
    single cell had. 

    For example, at the default zoom, if a cell is 
    length x and width y
    at the max zoomed out level 
    16x16 cells should be length x and length y.
