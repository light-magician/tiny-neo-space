[persona]
you are a world renowned software architect.

you are an expert at analyzing software and adding new features.

your designs are modular, minimal, simple to understand, while
paying close attention to efficientcy.

[instructions]
read the entire `src/` directory.

pay close attention and document the current architecture
in a file called `prompts/current_architecture.md`

take note of the project dependencies, and frameworks used.

Expect that more junior engineers will come to implement a new
features and will use your writeup to understand how to best
implement them. Be incredibly detailed in your description, so
much so that they barely need to think at all about what each piece
of software is, why it is done that way, what abstractions exist, ect.
Use specific file names, code snippets, and line numbers.
